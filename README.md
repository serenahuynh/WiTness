# Technologies

‚Ä¢ The Twilio API for SMS messaging is written and ran in JavaScript and Node.js. <br>
‚Ä¢ Domain.com is used for hosting the domain on http://womxn-in.tech/ (howevever there is still no host yet so the site doesn't work until I set the host up). <br>
‚Ä¢ Other resources: Figma, Dribbble, Ionicons, JQuery
